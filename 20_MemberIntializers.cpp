/*  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/when-do-we-use-initializer-list-in-c/
    Initializer List is used in initializing the data members of a class. The list of members 
    to be initialized is indicated with constructor as a comma-separated list followed by a colon. 
    there are situations where initialization of data members inside constructor doesnâ€™t work and 
    Initializer List must be used

    1) For initialization of non-static const data members
        const data members must be initialized using Initializer List.
